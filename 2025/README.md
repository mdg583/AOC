# Advent of Code 2025

I decided to try to do Advent of Code as much as possible using R. I'm aiming for solutions that seem interesting algorithmically, and not worrying too much about code readability.

A helpful thing about R is that it seems suited to expressing the intent of an algorithm without showing many implementation details. For loops are very slow, so this motivates looking for alternative algorithms and using vectors where possible. I imagine AOC problems will become quite difficult to solve with R, and I may try to write small pieces in C/C++.
